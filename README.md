## üìå Overview  
This hands-on workshop introduces participants to modern AI tools for bioimage analysis. We will explore deep learning frameworks, reproducible pipelines, segmentation methods, and community-driven resources.  

1. **Hands-on Deep Learning with ZeroCostDL4Mic**  
   - Image reconstruction in SMLM using **DeepSTORM** ([Nehme et al., Optica 2018](https://www.osapublishing.org/optica/abstract.cfm?uri=optica-5-4-458))  

2. **Reproducible AI-pipelines with DL4MicEverywhere**  

3. **Zero-Shot Segmentation with DINOSim**  

4. **Exploration of the BioImage Model Zoo**

## 4. üåê The BioImage Model Zoo  

**Goal:** Discover and test community models for imaging tasks.  

### Requirements
- Browser: **Google Chrome**  

### Recommended Exploration  
Visit: [bioimage.io](https://bioimage.io/#/) and try pretrained models, such as:  
- **placid-llama**  
- **sincere-microbe**  
- **loyal-squid**  
- **ambitious-sloth**  
- **powerful-chipmunk**

## ‚úÖ Final Notes  
- Please ensure **Google Colab and Docker** are set up in advance.  
- All required datasets and pretrained models are bundled in the [workshop data release](https://github.com/esgomezm/AI-Workshop-youngSMLMS-2025/releases/tag/data).  
- Tutorials are structured to be progressive: start with **DeepSTORM**, move to **DL4MicEverywhere**, then explore **DINOSim** and the **Model Zoo**.
