## üìå Overview  
This hands-on workshop introduces participants to modern AI tools for bioimage analysis. We will explore deep learning frameworks, reproducible pipelines, segmentation methods, and community-driven resources.  

1. **Hands-on Deep Learning with ZeroCostDL4Mic**  
   - Image reconstruction in SMLM using **DeepSTORM** ([Nehme et al., Optica 2018](https://www.osapublishing.org/optica/abstract.cfm?uri=optica-5-4-458))  

2. **Reproducible AI-pipelines with DL4MicEverywhere**  

3. **Zero-Shot Segmentation with DINOSim**  

4. **Exploration of the BioImage Model Zoo**  

Data and pretrained models:

## 2. üñ•Ô∏è DL4MicEverywhere  

**Goal:** Explore how to build reproducible and portable AI workflows. I will show how to use it step by step rather than going through a hands-on. 

### Requirements  
1. [DL4MicEverywhere](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/DL4MicEverywhere)  
   - Test with: **U-Net_2D_Multilabel_ZeroCostDL4Mic.ipynb** 
2. Docker  
   - Installed automatically at first launch (if not, download from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/))  
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires **root access** for first time installation  

### Step-by-Step Exercises  
Follow the detailed walkthrough provided in:  
[DL4MicEverywhere Workshop Guidelines ‚Äì I2K 2024](https://gist.github.com/esgomezm/fe455b3a5c5fdd6e33c0958ddcf331ed)

## 3. üß© DINOSim: Zero-Shot Segmentation  

**Goal:** Try transformer-based ZeroShot segmentation with little manual prompting.  

- Tool: [napari-DINOSim](https://github.com/AAitorG/napari-DINOSim) (napari plugin) installed locally
- Data: **EVs-EM.zip** downloaded locally (available in the [workshop data](https://github.com/esgomezm/AI-Workshop-youngSMLMS-2025/releases/tag/data))  
- Paper: A. Gonz√°lez-Marfil, E. G√≥mez-de-Mariscal, I. Arganda-Carreras, DINOSim: Zero-Shot Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation on Electron Microscopy Images, bioRxiv 2025 [DOI:10.1101/2025.03.09.642092](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.09.642092)

## 4. üåê The BioImage Model Zoo  

**Goal:** Discover and test community models for imaging tasks.  

### Requirements
- Browser: **Google Chrome**  

### Recommended Exploration  
Visit: [bioimage.io](https://bioimage.io/#/) and try test-running pretrained models on the browser, such as:  
- **placid-llama**  
- **sincere-microbe**  
- **loyal-squid**  
- **ambitious-sloth**  
- **powerful-chipmunk**
