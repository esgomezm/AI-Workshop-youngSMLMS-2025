## 2. DL4MicEverywhere 
Requirements 

1. **DL4MicEverywhere**: Download from [GitHub](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/DL4MicEverywhere).
   - Launch it for the first time to ensure that it works. You can try it with the notebook: `U-Net_2D_Multilabel_ZeroCostDL4Mic.ipynb`

2. **Docker**: DL4MicEverywhere will attempt to install this automatically on first launch. If this fails, download from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/)
   - Note: Root access is required for installation
